May want to query historic events…

When a new currency enters the blockchain transaction list, find ALL the transactions which deal with that one asset.  That way we don’t need to track a bunch of BS trying to figure out which assets went in and out…


TRY THIS FIRST!!
Also https://docs.ethers.io/v5/concepts/events/#events--logs-and-filtering  Filter by log events
where we can call any TransferFrom or transferTo
